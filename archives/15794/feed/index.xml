					<description><![CDATA[hi,  nice to talk to you,  u r giving metaphore as scientific explanation,  I think u still believe in islam,  that&#039;s why u r writing against it,  to feel you hate it,
if u know islam is wrong why wasting time on it?  I just asked simply. curious to know you.  
u r feminist,  I don&#039;t like these types of ppl. truly to say. cz if anything happens between a grl and a boy a feminist force to prove that the boy is wrong. grl are soft,  they don&#039;t do hard job. although he is a boy. I just thought about you. don&#039;t mind on it.
and if you find a religion based on science,  how many ppl will make it,  u think,  are ppl around einstein or newton. even newtons theory are proved wrong after 1000 yrs by einstein theory. then how long a religion will hold based on science. I don&#039;t know. our knowledge about science always change or upgrade or degrade.
whatever I just thought about it. nothing else I think to fight with.]]></description>
